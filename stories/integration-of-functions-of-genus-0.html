<h2>Construction and mapping properties</h2>
<p>Let $K(x)$ denote the field of rational functions over a subfield
$K$ of $\mathbf{C}$. (Here $x$ denotes the identity mapping of
the Riemann sphere.)
A quadratic function field $F$ of genus 0 over $K$ is an extension
of $K(x)$ generated by an element
$y$ satisfying an equation $y^2 = p(x)$ where $p$
is a polynomial of degree $2$ (or $1$) with coefficients in $K$.
All elements of $F$ can then be written in the form $f(x) + g(x)y$,
where $f$ and $g$ are polynomials in $K[X]$.</p>
<p>The element $y$ of $F$ is not a function in $\mathbf{C}$ in the
ordinary sense. However, in suitable subdomains $U$ of $\mathbf{C}$
there exist actual functions $y_1$ satisfying $y_1^2 = p(x)$ in $U$.
Each element of $F$ then corresponds to a function in $U$, when
expressed in terms of such a  <em>branch</em> $y_1$ of $y$.
These function can be integrated as usual in $U$.</p>
<p>It is well-known that such integrals may be transformed to
integrals of rational functions by a suitable (quadratic) change of the
integration variable. (In fact, fields of genus 0 <em>are</em> rational.
If $a$ is a root of $p$, then after substituting $y = t(x-a)$ into
$y^2 = p(x)$ both $x$ and $y$ become rational expressions of $t$.)
However, it is worth-while to consider these integrals without
such transformations, because they have served as models for
elliptic integrals.</p>
<p>To find convenient domains for branches of $y$, consider first the
simple case of $y^2 = x$. None of the branches
$y_1$ may be defined in a domain containing $0$, since $y_1^2$ cannot
have simple zero. A standard domain of definition for the square root is
the complement $U$ of the negative real axis. The real parts of the
two square roots of any point in $U$ are non-zero. The roots with positive
real part then define a single-valued branch $\sqrt{x}$.</p>
<img alt="/images/sqr1.png" class="align-center" src="../images/sqr1.png" style="width: 650px; height: 300px;"><p>The imaginary part of the branch is positive above the negative real
axis, and negative below it, as indicated in the picture. Hence the
branch $\sqrt{x}$ is maximal; it is impossible to extend it
to a neighborhood of any point in the negative real axis.</p>
<p>The square roots with negative real part define another branch equal
to $-\sqrt{x}$. Its imaginary part is negative above the negative real
axis, and positive below it. Following Riemann we may imagine setting
one copy of the domain $U$ on top of another and joining
them crosswise along the negative real axis. On this <em>two-sheeted
Riemann surface</em>
the two branches combine to a single-valued holomorphic function $y$
with square $x$ (whose values are repeated on both sheets).</p>
<p>Consider now the general situation where $y^2 = p(x)$ and $p$ is a
quadratic polynomial with distinct roots. By a linear transformation
of the form $x\mapsto ax + b$ the roots may be moved to any
two points in the complex plane. (The  ground field $K$ may have to be
extended to include the roots of $p$.) There are two standard
choices for these points, $0$ and $1$, or the more symmetric pair
of $-1$ and $1$.</p>
<p>We shall discuss the latter case. The transformed polynomial will
then be $p(x) = c(x-1)(x+1) = c(x^2 - 1)$. The leading coefficient
$c$ may also be replaced by rescaling $y$ (and possibly extending
$K$ again). The standard choice is $-1$ to make $p(0)$ positive.
Thus we arrive at the standard form  $$ y^2 = 1 - x^2. $$</p>
<p>As shown in the <a class="reference external" href="integration-of-quadratic-functions.html">previous note</a> all integrals depending
rationally on $x$ and $y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ can be reduced to a
linear combination of the following <em>integrals of the third kind</em>
$$ \int \frac{dx}{y},\qquad \int \frac{dx}{(x-c)y}\quad(c\ne \pm 1).$$
(There a no integrals of the first and second kind.)</p>
<p>We shall consider the first integral, which has two poles at infinity.
Writing $1 - x^2 = (1+x)(1-x)$ we can construct branches of $y$
as follows. As seen above, $\sqrt{1+x}$ has a single-valued
branch in the complement of the interval from $-1$ to $-\infty$
with values in the right-hand side of the complex plane. Similarly,
$\sqrt{1-x}$ has a branch with the same property in the complement
of the interval from $1$ to $+\infty$. Hence we can define $y$ as
the product of these branches in the complex plane with two cuts
from $-\infty$ to $-1$ and from $1$ to $+\infty$. Let this domain be
be denoted by $V$. This branch with value $1$ at the origin will be
called the <em>positive branch</em>; the other one is the <em>negative branch</em>.</p>
<p>The two-sheeted Riemann surface $S$ of $y$ can now be constructed by
joining two copies of $V$ along the cuts.
In one copy, or "sheet", $y$ is defined by the positive branch,
and on the other one by the negative branch. We refer to them
as the positive and the negative sheet.</p>
<p>It is important for integration that the domain $V$ is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected_space">simply connected</a>. In fact,
any loop in $V$ can be contracted to a point in $V$ by reducing the
scale: $x\mapsto tx$ while $t$ traverses the interval from $1$ to $0$.</p>
<img alt="/images/sqr2.png" class="align-center" src="../images/sqr2.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;"><p>It then follows from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_theorem">Cauchy's integral theorem</a> that any holomorphic function $f$ in $V$
can be integrated, i.e., it has an indefinite integral, or
<em>antiderivative</em>, $F$ in $V$ such that
$F' = f$. Moreover, if $\gamma$ is a piecewise smooth path from $a$ to
$b$ in $V$, then the path integral
$$ \int_\gamma f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) $$
only depends on the end points of the path.</p>
<img alt="/images/sqr3.png" class="align-center" src="../images/sqr3.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;"><p>This means that an antiderivative $F$ can be computed
by starting from a fixed point, the origin, for example,
and integrating along any convenient path to a variable point in $V$.</p>
<p>Now, consider the indefinite integral $F$ in $V$ of $f = 1/y$, where
$y=\sqrt{1-x^2}$ is the positive
branch $\sqrt{1+x}\sqrt{1-x}$ is taking the value $1$
at the origin. Then $1/y$ is real and positive in the open interval
$]-1,1[$. Setting $F(0)=0$ we see that
$$ F(t) = \int_0^t \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} $$
is real and strictly increasing in the open interval $]-1,1[$, with
the limits
$$ \lim_{t\to 1} F(t) = \int_0^1  \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} =
\frac{\pi}{2} $$
and $\lim_{t\to -1} F(t) = -\pi/2$ at the end points.
On the imaginary axis the values of $F$ are purely imaginary as may
be seen by setting $x=it$ for real values of $t$:
$$ F(it) = \int_0^t \frac{i\,d\tau}{\sqrt{1 + \tau^2}}. $$</p>
<p>The imaginary part of $y$ is negative
above the interval $[1,\infty[$
(coming from the imaginary part of $\sqrt{1-x}$).
Hence on the upper side $F$ has the limit
$$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0+} F(t + i\epsilon) = \frac{\pi}{2} +
\int_1^t \frac{dx}{-i\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} $$
with real part $\pi/2$ and logarithmically growing positive imaginary part.</p>
<p>Below the interval the sign of the imaginary part is positive, and the
limit of $F$ has negative imaginary part. The limit values of $F$
in the interval $]-\infty,-1]$ follow by symmetry ($F$ is odd, since
$y$ is an even function).
Hence we see that $F$ maps the domain $V$ onto the vertical strip
formed by the points with real part between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$.
Thus the image of a loop extending to the interval $[1,+\infty[$
becomes an open path.</p>
<img alt="/images/arc1.png" class="align-center" src="../images/arc1.png" style="width: 650px; height: 200px;"><p>Consider now the negative branch $-\sqrt{1-x^2}$ of $y$ in $V$. One of
the antiderivatives of $1/y$ is then $-F$.
It maps the paths from the origin to the interval $[1,\infty[$
to paths ending at points with real value $-\pi/2$.</p>
<img alt="/images/arc2.png" class="align-center" src="../images/arc2.png" style="width: 650px; height: 200px;"><p>However, if we first integrate with the positive branch along a path from
the origin to a point in the interval $[1,\infty[$, and then
continue with the negative branch after passing over the interval to
the other sheet in the Riemann surface, we obtain the
antiderivative $-F +\pi$. It maps the domain $V$ onto the vertical
strip containing the points with real part between $\pi/2$
and $3\pi/2$.</p>
<img alt="/images/arc3.png" class="align-center" src="../images/arc3.png" style="width: 650px; height: 200px;"><p>In the same way, if the path of integration extends over the interval
$]-\infty,-1]$ we pass over to the region of points with real part
in $[-3\pi/2, -\pi/2]$; or $[3\pi/2, 5\pi/2]$ when
the path first crosses $[1,+\infty[$.</p>
<img alt="/images/arc4.png" class="align-center" src="../images/arc4.png" style="width: 650px; height: 200px;"><p>Hence we see that there is no single-valued indefinite integral of
$1/y$ on the Riemann surface $S$
(the surface is not simply connected).
The values of path interals do not depend on end points alone,
even on the surface $S$ where $y$ in single-valued.
The dependence on the path is fairly restricted, however.
The integral of $1/y$ over a simple loop in $S$ has the value $2\pi$
(or $-2\pi$, in the opposite direction). It is called a <em>period</em>
of the integral $\int dx/y$.</p>
<img alt="/images/arc5.png" class="align-center" src="../images/arc5.png" style="width: 650px; height: 200px;"><p>The value of the path integral of $1/y$ over a general loop (in $S$)
is a multiple of $2\pi$,
depending on the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number">winding number</a>
of the loop around the interval $[-1,1]$.
It follows that the integrals over any two paths with the same
end points (in $S$) differ by a multiple of $2\pi$, at most.
In fact, the difference of the integrals is the integral over
the loop formed by one of the paths composed with the inverse of
the other one.</p>
<p>The mapping properties of the multi-valued indefinite integral
obtained by path integrals now become obvious.
The positive sheet of $S$ is mapped onto the vertical strip
between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$ on the real axis and, in addition,
to all strips obtained from it by translation by a multiple
of $2\pi$. The negative sheet is mapped onto the strips
remaining in between.</p>

<div class="section" id="inversion-of-the-integral">
<h2>Inversion of the integral</h2>
<p>Although the indefinite integral $\int dx/y$ is multiple-valued
on the Riemann surface $S$, its inverse is single-valued.
As seen above, the inverse is defined
everywhere in the complex plane and has the period $2\pi$.
Each vertical strip of width $2\pi$ is mapped onto the surface
in one-to-one manner. Such strips are called <em>fundamental regions</em>
of the mapping.</p>
<p>The inverse may be conveniently defined by giving its two coordinates,
$x$ and $y$ (which are related by $y^2 = 1 - x^2$).
From elementary analysis we know that for real arguments in the
interval $[-1,1]$ the integral is the <em>arcsine</em> function:
$$ \arcsin x = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}. $$
This equality is still valid the complex domain $V$, since the derivative
of the complex $\arcsin x$ is $1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$. So the indefinite integral
denoted by $F$ above is, in fact, the <em>principal branch</em> of arcsine.
The $x$-coordinate of the inverse mapping is therefore the sine,
at least in the strip between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$.
This also holds in the strip between $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$
where the integral is $\pi - F = \pi - \arcsin$,
since $\sin(\pi - z) = \sin(z)$. It follows that $y$ is given
by the cosine. By periodicity we then obtain the inverse mapping
for all complex values
$$ x = \sin z,\qquad y = \cos z. $$
A rational function of $x$ and $y$ is transformed by these
substitutions to a meromorphic function in the complex plane
with a period $2\pi$ and only a finite number of zeros and poles
in a fundamental region.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-integrals-of-the-third-kind">
<h2>Other integrals of the third kind</h2>
<p>The other basic integrals of the third kind
$$ \int \frac{dx}{(x-c)y}\qquad (c\ne \pm 1) $$
are regular at the infinity but have two simple poles on the Riemann
surface at $x=c$.
They can be reduced to $\int dx/y$ by a fractional linear transformation
$$ \xi = \frac{\alpha x + \beta}{\gamma x + \delta} $$
taking $c$ to $\infty$ $(\gamma c + \delta = 0)$ and leaving $\pm 1$ fixed
$(\alpha+\beta = \gamma+\delta, -\alpha+\beta = \gamma-\delta)$.
These three equations determine the
coefficients up to a common multiplicative constant, which does not
affect the mapping, however.</p>
<p>In the case $c=0$ the mapping is simply $\xi = 1/x$, and then
the integral becomes
$$ \int \frac{dx}{xy} = \int \frac{-\xi^{-2}d\xi}
{\xi^{-1}\sqrt{1-\xi^{-2}}}
= \int \frac{-d\xi}{i\sqrt{1 - \xi^2}}, $$
which differs from $\int dx/y$ by the factor $i$ only. The other
cases may be handled similarly.</p>
